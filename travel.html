      <h2>hong kong - nov '25</h2>
      <br>
      <h2>vietnam, thailand and cambodia - may '25</h2>

      <p>
        Joined a solo travelers' backpacking group for 2 weeks. We started in Bangkok, where highlights included cruising the Chao Phraya River, Chinatown, getting lost on local buses, savoring street Pad Thai + Tea, visiting Wat Pho, and day-tripping to Ayutthaya. I enjoyed an abundance of fresh rambutan and mangosteen along the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, I spent 9 days in Cambodia, discovering the magnificent Angkor Wat temples near Siem Reap, trying chilli-fried crickets in Phnom Penh, relaxing on the beaches of Koh Rong, and spending a night with the local farming community in Chambok. Standout moments included getting interrogated by Cambodian border control, a 4am wakeup for sunrise at Angkor Wat, a sombering experience at S-21 and the Killing Fields in Phnom Penh, and a stunningly-picteresque hike up to Chambok Canyon.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also visited a traditional two-story straw cottage on the Cambodia countryside, where I enjoyed a delicious lunch of noodles and lemongrass-coconut chicken served on the floor.
      </p>

      <p>
        Post Cambodia, I spent 3 days in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where I shopped till I dropped at Ben Thanh Market, Saigon Square, and Takashimaya. Book Street, the War Remnants Museum, Little Hanoi's Egg Coffee, and Banana pancakes w/ extra S·ªØa √îng Th·ªç condensed milk, made by my hostel hosts, were some highlights. I'm also very proud of my myself for crossing the road without getting run over, and managing to take an hour's local back to the aiport.

    <h2>japan - mar '25</h2>
  <p>
  Spent my birthday week in Japan, averaging over 30,000 steps a day, 8 Shinkansen rides and 22 local trains ‚Äî essentially a speedrun of public transit. I landed in Osaka, and took a day trip to Nara to stare at friendly deer, savor some delicious matcha ice cream, and explore Todai-ji. Evenings buzzed with the lively energy of Osaka‚Äôs Namba markets, where I devoured (octopus) takoyaki.
</p>

<p>
  The next day, I caught the Shinkansen to Hiroshima and later a ferry to Miyajima. Along the way, I squeezed in thrift shopping at Mode-Off and stocked up on discount skincare at Matsumoto Kiyoshi‚Äîjust before the tourist tax kicked in. I also got lost in the mountains near Waratenjinmae after dozing off on the bus‚Äîa surprising, yet welcome adventure.  Hiroshima was deeply moving, with the Peace Memorial Park and Museum leaving a lasting impression. I enjoyed Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki and indulged in melon bread while watching the sunrise over Hiroshima Castle. On Miyajima Island, I caught the iconic Itsukushima Shrine‚Äôs torii gate magically floating as the tide came in.
</p>

<p>
  Kyoto‚Äôs bamboo forest and Golden Pavilion were breathtaking. I had the best meal of my life‚Äîa katsu curry in Arashiyama‚Äîand later treated myself to warabi mochi in Kamakura.
</p>

<p>
  Day four brought me to Tokyo, starting with the historic Asakusa district and Senso-ji Temple. I wandered Ueno Park and did some serious shopping, and then explored Nakano Broadway for vintage toys and treasures. A delicious ramen bowl in Harajuku fueled me for an evening in Shibuya, marveling at the famous crossing and finishing with late-night sushi.
